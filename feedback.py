Provide a feedback message to the student which describes whether the part of the problem statement they clicked on explains the expected output.

The system previously identified that correct answers include execution trace steps with indices {data['correct_answers']}. Answers with these indices should always be considered correct, although it's possible that other correct answers exist.

{data['direction']}

**Step 2. What should we look into?**
{data['observation']}

**Step 3. Let's investigate!**
{data['action']}

Now, the system asked the student:
<explanation_question>
**What do you think?** Can you explain why your code didn't do the right thing?
<explanation_question>

And the student responed:
<student_explanation_response>
{data['student_explanation']}
</student_explanation_response>

Provide feedback to this student response. Include the following considerations:
- Did the student identify any correct aspects of where their code went wrong in this execution trace? If so, ackowledge the correct things the student said, and elaborate on them if necessary
- Did the student say something that was explicitly wrong? If so, explain which part you think is incorrect, and why you think so.
- If the student asked any explicit questions, try to answer them in a way that describes programming concepts and constructs, but does not explicitly tell the student why their code is wrong or how to fix it.
- Did the student express any uncertainty or confusion? If so, try to give them a suggestion for how they can think about this question.

Keep in mind that the student was **only** asked why the code didn't do the right thing in this particular execution trace; they are not necessarily trying to explain how the code should be fixed. They are also not trying to reason about other potential problems that did not get triggered in this particular execution trace. If they explain the "why" adequately about this specific execution trace, treat their answer as completely correct. 

After providing the feedback, decide whether the student successfully explained why the code didn't do the right thing, or whether they need to update their explanation to be more complete.
