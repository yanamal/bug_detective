This is a Flask app demo of a debugging assistant app.

Before running it, you will need to get a Gemini API key and save it in api_key.txt at the top directory level.

To run the app, you should be able to simply use `python app.py` in a terminal.

Then, go to the local URL that Flask gives you to see a list of the different available examples.

It combines output from my algorithmic [Fix Explainer](https://github.com/yanamal/python_fix_explainer) prototype with some LLM use (specifically, Gemini Flash 2.0)
to walk a hypothetical student through understanding why and how their code is wrong.

The "fix explainer" data is pre-generated for several problems using the code in  [simple_fix_gen](https://github.com/yanamal/simple_fix_gen). 
If you want to test it with different problems and solutions, the html generated by simple_fix_gen should work nearly out of the box - 
it may need a couple of different imports at the top, sorry. (these imports may also be different for the "conversational" version and the more "UI based" version, sorry)
